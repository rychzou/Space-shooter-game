<h2>Space Shooter</h2>
==========================================================================================================
<h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>

<p>This is my recreated version of a vertical space shooter game in "Greenfoot," a Java IDE.</p>

<p>A player will be controlling a spaceship that can fire projectiles at obstacles that come your way. Aliens will randomly come from the top of the screen, along with Asteroids and Health Packs. Aliens that reach the bottom of the screen will cost you health. Health Packs collected by the player will gain health points.</p>

<p>Arrow keys are used for movement and the space bar is fire.</p>

<h4>Disclaimer</h4>

<p>I do not own any of the pictures. Everything was already a part of Greenfoot with the exception of the "win" and "lost" images.</p>
